# 7 Yoga Poses Increase Your Self-Confidence

### One of the most effective ways to build self-confidence is through our posture. According to research done by Harvard and Columbia, the body posture is capable of transmitting signals to our minds about our self-confidence and affecting how decisions are made in real-time.

# The studies show that a "power posture" - Standing back upright with your shoulders pulled back, head aligned with the spine, and looking up and forward, helps strengthen security and decision making. The power posture has a positive effect on self-confidence. It can enhance self-image, raise positive memories, encourage positive thinking, and reduce cortisol levels - the stress hormone.

# Yoga practice will gradually teach you how to change your body's posture. The changes will radically transform your self-confidence, as they will impact positively the way you present yourself to others.

The sequence of poses offered below will allow you to empower your shoulders, chest, and spine, and appear with more confidence and courage in your life. We recommend staying in each position for five breaths. Then return to Downward-Facing Dog and repeat on the other side.
