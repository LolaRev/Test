# A practical guide to achieve a life balance

How many times have you found yourself trying to juggle between work, home, relationships, health, friends, family, and realized that despite all your efforts, you were still missing focus on an aspect of your life that you believed important? How many times have you promised yourself to dedicate more time to your hobbies, physical and mental health, but again fail to do so? If you are nodding in agreement (and chances are you agree), then you may possibly have difficulty reaching balance in life. 

## Why is finding a life balance important?
Throughout our life journey, we often find ourselves trying to juggle between many priorities at the same time. Most of us live our daily lives at a tremendous speed, rarely slowing down to truly listen to our needs and to empower ourselves to meet those needs. In these situations, addressing the importance of life balance as a guide can become a means to feeling greater fulfillment. Furthermore, defining what balance means to us and how we implement it in life is more challenging.

Balance is a strategy that aims to enable us to manage and maximize our lives better. It is a way of regulating, pacing, and focusing our attention on areas in life that are important to us. When we are busy, we usually focus our energy on one area in life and tend to neglect others. Aiming for balance enables us to invest our resources in what we each consider the essential areas of life, without feeling drained.

To help visualize the idea of balance, try to imagine an acrobat juggling several balls. Each ball represents a different aspect of life, such as health, family, work, relationships, society, and so on. To enable continuity of the rotating movement, the juggler needs to divide attention between all the balls. However, the attention to the two balls that the juggler is passing between hands might require more attention at any given moment. 

This visualization contributes to an understanding of the three parameters of balance: 
Dynamic flow - As priorities in life keep changing, so should balance. It needs to stay dynamic and be redefined with time. 
Pivot point - The pivot point is the juggler. Placing yourself in the centre facilitates awareness of the impact of life events on your priorities and how you re-create balance that feels meaningful with changing factors.
Attention - Balance does not mean that you have to do everything all the time. It means that you have to understand the difference between 'important' and 'urgent' and consider them dynamic variants.
 
## The dynamic flow of life to achieve inner peace
In life's race, we often tend to find ourselves drifting into an intense pace. Most of us find it challenging to deal with a fast pace of life, packed with events, places, and people, and as a result, we find ourselves losing our anchor, and being in an imbalance affecting the body and mind.

We live a vibrant life, which is why events, aspirations, desires, places, and people vary from time to time. What was relevant at high-school is no longer valid for adulthood. What we focused on in our 20s may not still be relevant in our 40s. Our focus is changing as a result of good or challenging events, such as careers, parenting, relationships, and physical or mental conditions, which require us to stay mindful. These events affect the body and mind and shape our personality and who we become.

The dynamism in the balance allows us to break free of the sense of being stuck. The circular process of assessing and implementing leads to a sense of satisfaction and self-fulfillment because we set clear goals and consciously work to fulfill them. 

## Is it time for a change?
Life balance has a different meaning for each of us. For one, balance means harmonizing life in relationships and self-fulfillment. For another, balance means succeeding in combining career and family life. For another, balance means trying to find time for oneself in front of a busy schedule. 

For each one, the sense of balance is based on the harmony associated with the different roles we play in our lives. We all play different roles in life. We can be friends, family, parents, co-workers, community, neighbors. Hence, the attempt to balance the same areas must also be different - individualized.

The level of complexity increases as we take on more roles, splitting our attention among all of them. The common belief is that we must strive for perfection in each role we play and that is an unrealistic and impossible goal. As a result, we find ourselves in an impossible chase for perfection, ending with perpetual frustration, high levels of stress, which affects our mental and physical health.

It is important to remember that one's idea of balance may be interpreted as an imbalance from another person's point of view. Therefore, in our effort to establish balance and harmony in our lives, it is vital to place ourselves in the pivot point, and question our roles and choices by asking ourselves, what do I want? What is the right thing for now? What do I choose to do? And how do I choose to feel?

## An important part of finding life balance
Against common belief, balance does not mean that you have to do everything all the time. It means you learn to slow down and prioritize your attention to different aspects of life, the roles, based on a conscious decision. Slowing down the pace does not mean that we stop doing things; it means that we can disconnect ourselves from the ongoing race to recognize where we are and how this place affects us.

By striving to balance, we emphasize the difference between the 'need' and 'urgent':
 - The 'need' - highlights the effects of the environment on us. The 'need' leads to a situation where we are in the sense of perpetual chase. No matter how hard we try, we will not be able to do everything we planned. 
 - The 'urgent' - highlights the self. The 'urgent' helps to identify and prioritize the variety of areas of life. It encourages us to make an informed decision on which verticals will get our most attention and which will be depleted, for the near future.


# The life circle - how to define and find our life balance
Moving on to practice, we would like to suggest a practical, simple, and quick tool to help achieve a life balance - The Wheel of Life. The Wheel of Life is a popular coaching assessment tool created by Paul J. Meyer, founder of Success MotivationÂ® Institute, Inc. It helps to visualize your life by mapping areas in life occupying you at the moment and measuring the level of satisfaction of each area.

Often in life, when asked if we are happy and pleased with our lives, we can state our general condition but find it hard to point out the reason why. We can feel unhappy or unsatisfied (or happy and satisfied), but when asked why the standard answer reveals uncertainty. The wheel provides a 'helicopter view,' which makes it easier to identify the Why by identifying which areas in life need work and which are satisfying.

## How to work with the wheel
To begin with, Joie welcomes you to download a free worksheet that contains a blank Wheel of Life diagram and the list of actions.


Things I will START doing to regain balance in my life
Things I will STOP doing, reprioritize or delegate


### Step 1 - Select Your Wheel of Life Categories
You will need to identify the main areas in life that are important to you or that are keeping you busy. The areas are individual and can vary from one person to another. However, please have a critical consciousness of the areas you choose. Sometimes, it will be hard to identify last attended areas simply because we forgot to pay attention to them. We still need them on the list to notice the lack of focus on these areas.Your list should include both your strengths and your weaknesses.

For your convenience, we gathered the most common areas for a balanced life:
 - Personal Growth
 - Physical and Mental Health
 - Family and Home
 - Relationship and Romance
 - Social Life
 - Life Purpose 
 - Career
 - Finance

### Step 2 - Evaluation
Once you have identified your areas, go through each area, and grade it on a scale between 1 (unsatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). The guideline for the grading should be how satisfied you are with this area for the time being. For example, it could be that your social life is not very active. However, if it is a matter of choice, your satisfaction level should be higher, and so is your grade.

### Step 3 - Reflection
Now that you have a visual representation of your life, it is time to reflect and identify the gaps. Your reflection is twofold first reflected on each section separately and then on the whole. Ask yourself, what does this mean for you? What would the ideal level of attention be for each life area?

### Step 4 - Action
For the last step, we would like you to create a list of actions. Ask yourself what you could do to have more satisfaction in this area? The list should be divided into two parts, a list of things you should do, but at the same time, a list of things you should stop doing.

Remember, aiming for life balance does not mean you need to reach perfection in every aspect of life. It is about deciding what is the most important area for you and making sure you are aware of the blind spots that might lead to unhappiness. You are invited to use the wheel as frequently as needed and make adjustments when needed to reach your optimal life balance.

Joie wishes you the best of luck on your journey for life balance.
